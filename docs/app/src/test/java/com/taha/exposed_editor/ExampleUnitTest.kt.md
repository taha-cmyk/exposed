**Overview**
==========

The provided code is a simple unit test written in Kotlin. It is designed to test the basic arithmetic operation of addition. The test case is contained within a class called `ExampleUnitTest` and is marked with the `@Test` annotation.

**Function Descriptions**
=======================

### addition_isCorrect

This function is a test case that checks if the result of the addition operation `2 + 2` is correct.

#### Parameters

* None

#### Return Values

* None (the function is a test case and does not return any value)

#### Usage Examples

```kotlin
// To run the test, simply execute the test class
class ExampleUnitTest {
    @Test
    fun addition_isCorrect() {
        assertEquals(4, 2 + 2)
    }
}
```

**Class Description**
=====================

### ExampleUnitTest

This class contains a single test case for verifying the correctness of the addition operation.

#### Properties

* None

#### Functions

* `addition_isCorrect()`: a test case that checks the result of the addition operation `2 + 2`.

### JUnit Annotations

* `@Test`: indicates that the function is a test case.

### JUnit Assertions

* `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: checks if the expected result is equal to the actual result.

**Example Usage**
================

To write similar test cases, you can follow this pattern:

```kotlin
class MyUnitTest {
    @Test
    fun myTest() {
        assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult)
    }
}
```

Replace `MyUnitTest` with the name of your test class, `myTest` with the name of your test case, `expectedResult` with the expected result of the operation, and `actualResult` with the actual result of the operation.

### assertEquals

* `assertEquals(expected: Any, actual: Any)`: checks if the expected result is equal to the actual result.

Note: The `assertEquals` function is a part of the JUnit assertion library.
